## Presets
GarageBand's biggest advantage is its large number of presets for any instrument. 
## Guitar/Bass Presets 
If you chose Guitar or Bass when you first set up, you will be greeted with a view like this:

On the left are all the different guitar/bass amp settings. If you click on one of those categories you have a multitude of different pre-set amps to chose from.

At the bottom, you can dial in the EQ to your liking. GarageBand also has a variety of different effects pedals you can apply to your amp selection. They are found by clicking the pedal icon right above the word Reverb in the controls section.

Similar to the guitar presets, all of the different presets for all the different instruments are on the left hand side. Clicking on one will give you a dropdown with many more different options.
Also similar to guitar, you can alter the controls and EQ of your preset at the bottom of the page
