## *What is GarageBand?*
GarageBand is a user friendly digital audio workstation(DAW) devloped by Apple. GarageBand acts as a digital music studio allowing users to record and edit voices or instruments. GarageBand is the most beginner friendly of the DAW's but can still be challenging to understand for new users. GarageBand is also the largest free DAW, but yet has all the advanced features that an expensive DAW would have.
