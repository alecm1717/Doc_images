## Recording
When you have tried out all the different fun presets of GarageBand, it is now time to record. At the top of the screen is the recording tab, with the red button, start/stop controls, metronome, tempo/beat controls and count-in options.

The metronome will click to the established BPM once you hit record, and the count-in option (next to the metronome) will give you a 4 beat count from when you hit the record button to when it starts recording. Both of these can be toggled on and off. The red button is how you start and stop recording.

Once you hit record you will see the red line move across the screen counting off the measures as it passes. You can add multiple instruments and layer them by clicking the plus icon in the top left corner.

If you recorded with a MIDI controller, a midi conversion of your recording will be made available at the bottom of the screen, and you can then drag and drop to alter your sound.
